		<h2>What is ASL?</h2>
	</header>
	
	<p><b>American Sign Language</b>(ASL) is one of the language deaf people use to communicate in the world. It’s grammar differs from English. However, ASL is a full-fledged, independent language, comprised with its own grammer.
</p>
    <p>Although it is not sure, ASL is suggested that they were created about 200 years ago. It is also known as having the amalgamation of local sign languages and <b>French Sign Language</b> (LSF, or Langue des Signes Française), which is the reason why some ASL is still consisted of some hand movements that is in the two sign languages above.</p>
    <p>We use <b>visual movements</b> like facial expression and hand movements to sign ASL(not only ASL, but every sign language). Facial expression is especially important to communicate. If the facial expression goes wrong, it would be hard for the counterpart to know exactly what you’re trying to say, even though you make the right sign.  </p>

	<header><h2>Alphabets in ASL</h2></header>
	<p>All 26 alphabets, from a to z, can be to be expressed in ASL.</p>

<p>The reason we have to learn alphabets, not only certain words in ASL is that when we want to <b>stress a smaller concept under a subject</b>, we first name the subject and then spell out the smaller or relevant thing you want to say, using alphabets.</p>

<p>For example, if I want to say that I like violet, this is what I have to do: First, sign 'I like purple', then spell out 'violet'(but considering the real grammer in ASL, you should sign 'I' one more time after 'violet' to let your counterpart know that you finished your sentence).</p>

<p>Also, if we know alphabet hand movements, <b>we can simply spell out certain words</b> that you forgot or don’t know.<p/<p>So it is essential to learn alphabets when learning ASL.</p><p>I will show you how to spell alphabets in ASL. Most of the signs in the pictures below should be facing toward your counterpart. And you should read the explanation I wrote under every picture to make sure you make the right sign!</p>
